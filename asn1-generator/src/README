# Run the autogenerator

```
./generate_xxap.py
```

The above command reads the NGAP and F1AP ASN.1 files and overwrites various files in the f1ap and ngap Rust projects.

# Parse an ASN.1 file
Useful to debug problems with the grammar.

```
./parse.py ../asn/something/something.asn
```

# Test the first phase (ASN.1 syntax transform)

The ASN.1 is parsed and the resulting parse tree is then reorganized into a new simplified tree that is more conducive for Rust rendering.  The folowing command runs the suite of unit tests that focus on this first transform phase. 

```
./transform.py
```

# Test the second phase (Rust rendering)

The tree output by the transform phase is then converted to Rust.  The folowing command runs the suite of unit tests that focus on this second rendering phase. 

```
./render.py
```
