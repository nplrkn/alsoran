Alsoran is a Rust implementation of the Centralized Unit (CU) of the 5G RAN.

The CU is responsible for the control function of the gNodeB and runs the Radio Resource Control (RRC) 
and Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP).  

The CU is a subcomponent of a gNodeB.  It connects to 
- the 5G Core (5GC) using the NG interface
- the Distributed Unit (DU) using the F1 interface
- other gNodeB using the Xn-C interface.

The CU control and user plane are interconnected by the E1 interface.

The key 3GPP specifications are
-  TS38.300 - NR and NG-RAN Overall Description
-  TS38.401 - NG-RAN; Architecture description 
-  TS38.412 - NG signalling transport 
-  TS38.413 - NG Application Protocol (NGAP)
-  TS38.472 - F1 signalling transport
-  TS38.473 - F1 Application Protocol (F1AP)
-  TS38.331 - Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol specification
