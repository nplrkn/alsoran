# Backlog

This is focused on the next release (0.1).  For longer term items, put them in the roadmap or put a TODO in the code.

## TO DO
- Fix failing test
- Get approval to publish
- Rerun live test
- Review all readmes as seen on Github
- Set to public
-----------
- Have the integration test not use real sockets and run in parallel
-----------
- Single async fn / task that sends the Rrc Setup and waits for Rrc Setup Complete
-----------
- Ints should be Copy rather than Clone (e.g. AmfUeNgapId)
- Generate procedures for Rrc.  Need a new kind of transport provider (not an SCTP one).
- Implement setuprelease
- Deduplicate inline definitions in RRC autogeneration
- Fix clippy
-----------
- Make values in NG Setup configurable rather than hard coded (Tac, Plmn Id, slices, etc)
-----------
- Have the integration test not use real sockets and run in parallel
- Adopt https://github.com/cucumber-rs/cucumber for integration tests
- Enforce Rust docs (see .cargo/config commented out compiler option)
- Remodel SCTP API to follow the one in the webrtc-sctp crate.

## RETEST

## DONE
- Code review (incl commented out code and TODOs) - gnbcu
- Redo roadmap
- In demo, gnbdu-sim has inconsistent message logging
- At end of demo, gnbcu panicked on Ctrl-C with 'not yet implemented'.  AMF was Ctrl-C'd first.  AMF logs indicate it is sending AMF Status Indication.  Crash is in ngap_gnb.rs.  Add an FV for this.
- Remove the weird TNLA 3, TNLA 53 IDs
- Three lines for each log sucks
- In demo, gnbcu logs strangely end with ">> UlRrcMessageTransfer".  Where's the uplink message?
- In demo, gnbcu logs saying UlRrcMessageTransfer should include (nas) 
- In demo, inconsistent debug log "Got Downlink Nas Transport - send RRC to UE via DU"
- In demo, downgrade log Accepted connection from Some(127.0.0.1:60313), since we already have an INFO log for that
- In demo, consider merging 'Accepted SCTP connection from 127.0.0.1:60313' and 'NGAP TNLA 3 established' into single INFO log
- In demo, inconsistent debug log "InitialUeMessage >"
- Write up reliable demo instructions starting with download of free5GC
- Add quickstart instructions and notes on current status to top readme
- Bump deps
- Move to consistent message logging
- Regression test integration covering same ground as live test with free5GC
- Pretty Ue initial context and move into separate modules
- Fix malformed CellGroupConfig issue seen in Wireshark in F1AP UEContextSetupResponse -- DUtoCURRCInformation, cellGroupConfig shown as <MISSING>
- Build go code using cargo build.
- Fix code that does match match
- Registration (23.502, figure 4.2.2.2-1) wrapped in UE Initial Access procedure (38.401, figure 8.1-1) working against free5GC as seen in ngap_setup.pcap.
- Go program that processes NAS information
- Encapsulate RRC in PDCP PDU
- gnbdu-sim
- RRC autogeneration
- Multi worker code (including coordinator) moved to a 'prototype' version leaving remaining code super simple
- NG Setup working again against free5GC using the instructions in [the free5gc howto](../howto/free5GC-testing.md).
- Add error messages to ASN.1 library + get it upstreamed
- GNB-CU code moved to a subdirectory (leaving code shared with DU or AMF at top level).
- Autogeneration of procedures etc
- Fix Address already in use warning seen in tests.  Refactor so that the listen() fails more obviously. 
- Test should fail if the F1AP SCTP bind fails 
- 'Worker confirms successul TNLA initialization' is output before output of AMF sending setup response
- send request instead of send pdu
- Test script as DU can send Setup and get response 
- Test script as DU can connect to CU
- Create callback client on coordinator
- Drive NG Setup from callback server
- Drive RAN configuration update from coordinator
- Start callback server on worker
- Develop callback in node control API.
- test the sctp receive function
- sort out TODOs and unwraps()
- commonize TNLA pool
- try out the Hampi library to decode the response at least?
- start fake amf
- get info / trace levels right
- get tests passing cleanly
- remove bindgen test cruft
- on startup, the worker should connect to node controller, get AMF address, connect
- fix typo refresh
- factor out logging and signal handling to common library
- treat that as a separate package within the same workspace for now
- create a basic POST API (later we add callback server)
- ok so we need to run OpenAPI generator
- Implement the node controller / investigate OpenAPI
- see if two alsorans can connect to one AMF
- documentation of features and level of testing
- socket OS errors getting hidden by anyhow
- Maintain + Retry 
- Successful NG Setup with Free5G.
- get rid of haphazard error conversion - see TODOs
- clean up sctp_association.rs
- Clippy
- send a fake ng setup and test the sctp receive function
- Properly close sockets when wrapper structs are dropped
- Stay up until Ctrl-C
- SCTP connect
- test against a free5GC
- add logging
- explore HA + use of SCTP.
