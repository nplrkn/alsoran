# Backlog
TO DO
- start fake amf
- start worker 2 passing node controller address:port
- pass logger in context
- sort out TODOs
- regression testing of maintain and retry scenarios
- test the sctp receive function
- See if the aper codec used in work is open source.
- Be test driven and get CI going
- hope that [https://github.com/gabhijit/hampi] gets an encode function.

------

DONE

- get info / trace levels right
- get tests passing cleanly
- remove bindgen test cruft
- on startup, the worker should connect to node controller, get AMF address, connect
- fix typo refresh
- factor out logging and signal handling to common library
- treat that as a separate package within the same workspace for now
- create a basic POST API (later we add callback server)
- ok so we need to run OpenAPI generator
- Implement the node controller / investigate OpenAPI
- see if two alsorans can connect to one AMF - yes.  though dubious we are sending two duplicate setups.

- [started] documentation of features and level of testing
- socket OS errors getting hidden by anyhow
- Maintain + Retry - i.e. test plan is
  
  1. start up Alsoran first then Free5GC [pass]
  2. start up free5G first then Alsoran [pass]
  3. kill and restart Free5GC [fail - doesn't notice]

- Successful NG Setup with Free5G.
- get rid of haphazard error conversion - see TODOs
- clean up sctp_association.rs
- Clippy
- send a fake ng setup and test the sctp receive function
  - by running wireshark and getting byte dump
    - wireshark Copy as hex stream, then hex::decode()
         00150035000004001b00080002f83910000102005240090300667265653567630066001000000000010002f839000010080102030015400140
- Properly close sockets when wrapper structs are dropped
- Stay up until Ctrl-C
- SCTP connect
- test against a free5GC
- add logging
- do two exchanges concurrently in UT
- most important area to explore is HA + use of SCTP.  Key point is that two instances of a single CU must share the same UE context, and a CU cannot assume it will receive a UE associated response on the same association as the one it sent the request on.
